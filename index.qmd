## Hello!

I'm a third-year Psychology PhD student, working with the [Logic of Emotion Lab](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flemolab.princeton.edu&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1DHeiAmd0pR-Ls0qXvKC8Q) at Princeton University.

I study how the language we use to label and regulate our emotions relates to mental wellbeing. My goal is to deepen our understanding of the psychological mechanisms behind mental health, so that these insights guide better prevention and treatment strategies.
